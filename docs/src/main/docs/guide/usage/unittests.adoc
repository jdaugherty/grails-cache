In general, code that is marked with cache related annotations can be unit
tested without doing anything special to deal with caching.  The caching just
won't be enabled and the code in cached methods will be executed each time the
method is invoked.

In order for caching to be active when the unit test is running, cache manager
and key generator beans must be added to the Spring application context by the
test.
